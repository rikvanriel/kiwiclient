# KiwiClient

This is a Python client for KiwiSDR. It allows you to:

* Receive data streams with audio samples, IQ samples, and waterfall data
* Issue commands to the KiwiSDR

## Dependencies

It is strongly recommended you use Python3.

Make sure the Python package `'numpy'` is installed.  
On many Linux distributions the command would be similar to `'apt install python3-numpy'`  
On macOS try `'pip3 install numpy'` or perhaps `'python3 -m pip install numpy'`

## Resampling

If you want high-quality resampling based on libsamplerate (SRC) you should build the version
contained in KiwiClient that has fixes rather than using the standard python-samplerate package.  
Follow these steps. Ask on the Kiwi forum if you have problems: `'forum.kiwisdr.com'`
* Install the Python package `'cffi'`
* Install the `'libsamplerate'` library using your system's package manager.
Note: this is not the Python package `'samplerate'` but the native code library `'libsamplerate'`
(e.g. x86\_64 or arm64).
    * Windows: download from `'github.com/libsndfile/libsamplerate/releases'`
    * Linux: use a package manager, e.g. `'apt install libsamplerate'`
    * macOS: use a package manager like brew: `'brew install libsamplerate'`
* Run the samplerate module builder `'make samplerate_build'`.
This generates a Python wrapper around `'libsamplerate'` in the file `'samplerate/_src.py'`
* Test by running `'make samplerate_test'`

If you can't build the Kiwi version then install the regular Python package: `'pip3 install samplerate'`  
If the either samplerate module is not found then low-quality resampling based on linear interpolation is used.

## Demo code

The following demo programs are provided. Use the `--help` argument to see all program options.

* `kiwirecorder`: Record audio to WAV files, with squelch. Option `--wf` prints various waterfall statistics. <br> Adding option `--wf-png` records the waterfall as a PNG file. `--help` for more info.
* `kiwiwfrecorder`: Specialty program. Saves waterfall data and GPS timestamps to .npy format file.
* `kiwifax`: Decode radiofax and save as PNGs, with auto start, stop, and phasing.
* `kiwiclientd`: Plays Kiwi audio on sound cards (real & virtual) for use by programs like fldigi and wsjtx.
    Implements hamlib rigctl network interface so the Kiwi freq & mode can be controlled by these programs.
* `kiwi_nc`: Command line pipeline tool in the style of `netcat`. Example: stream IQ samples to `dumphfdl`.

The `Makefile` contains numerous examples of how to use these programs.

## IS0KYB micro tools

Two utilities have been added to simplify the waterfall data acquisition/storage and data analysis.
The SNR ratio (a la Pierre Ynard) is computed each time.
There is now the possibility to change zoom level and offset frequency.

* `microkiwi_waterfall.py`: launch this program with no filename and just the SNR will be computed, with a filename, the raw waterfall data is saved. Launch with `--help` to list all options.
* `waterfall_data_analysis.ipynb`: this is a demo jupyther notebook to interactively analyze waterfall data. Easily transformable into a standalone python program.

The data is, at the moment, transferred in uncompressed format.

## Guide to the code

### kiwiclient.py

Base class for receiving websocket data from a KiwiSDR.
It provides the following methods which can be used in derived classes:

* `_process_audio_samples(self, seq, samples, rssi)`: audio samples
* `_process_iq_samples(self, seq, samples, rssi, gps)`: IQ samples
* `_process_waterfall_samples(self, seq, samples)`: waterfall data

### kiwirecorder.py
* Can record audio data, IQ samples, and waterfall data.
* The complete list of options can be obtained by `python3 kiwirecorder.py --help`.
* It is possible to record from more than one KiwiSDR simultaneously, see again `--help`.
* For recording IQ samples there is the `-w` or `--kiwi-wav` option: this writes	a .wav file which includes GNSS	timestamps (see below).
* AGC options can be specified in a YAML-formatted file, `--agc-yaml` option, see `default_agc.yaml`. Note that this option needs PyYAML to be installed

## IQ .wav files with GNSS timestamps
### kiwirecorder.py configuration
* Use the option `-m iq --kiwi-wav --station=[name]` for recording IQ samples with GNSS time stamps.
* The resulting .wav files contains non-standard WAV chunks with GNSS timestamps.
* If a directory with name `gnss_pos/` exists, a text file `gnss_pos/[name].txt` will be created which contains latitude and longitude as provided by the KiwiSDR; existing files are overwritten.

### Working with the recorded .wav files
* There is an octave extension for reading such WAV files, see `read_kiwi_wav.cc` where the details of the non-standard WAV chunk can be found; it needs to be compiled in this way: `mkoctfile read_kiwi_wav.cc`.
* For using read_kiwi_wav an octave function `proc_kiwi_iq_wav.m` is provided; type `help proc_kiwi_iq_wav` in octave for documentation.
